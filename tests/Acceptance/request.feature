Feature: Request Additional Information

  In order to complete claim processing
  As an admin
  I need to request additional information from customers

  Scenario: Requesting additional information
    Given I identify missing or unclear information in submitted claim documents
    When I request additional information from the customer
    Then the customer should be notified to provide the necessary documentation
    And the notification should include clear instructions on how to provide the requested information
    And the customer should have a convenient method to submit the requested documents, such as through an online portal or email attachment
    And upon receiving the requested documents, the claim processing should resume, with the updated information taken into consideration

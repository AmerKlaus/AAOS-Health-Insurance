Feature: Role-Based Access Controls

  In order to protect sensitive data
  As an admin
  I need to implement role-based access controls

  Scenario: Setting up role-based access controls
    Given I am logged into the admin panel
    When I configure access controls for different roles, such as admin, manager, and employee
    Then only authorized personnel should access sensitive claims data
    And admins should have full access to all system functionalities and data
    And managers should have access to view and manage claims data within their assigned department
    And employees should have limited access to view their own claims data and submit new claims
    And unauthorized users should be restricted from accessing sensitive claims data or system functionalities

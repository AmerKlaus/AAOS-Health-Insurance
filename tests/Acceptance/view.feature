Feature: View Claim Interactions and Add Audit Results
  In order to maintain comprehensive records and ensure compliance
  As an admin
  I need to view a claim and all associated interactions, and add audit results

  Scenario: Viewing a claim and associated interactions
    Given I am logged into the system
    When I view a specific claim and its interactions
    Then I should see all associated details and interactions

  Scenario: Adding audit results to a claim
    Given I am viewing a specific claim
    When I add audit results to the claim
    Then the audit results should be saved and associated with the claim

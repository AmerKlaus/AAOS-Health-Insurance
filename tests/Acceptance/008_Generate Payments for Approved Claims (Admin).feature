Feature: Generate Payments
  In order to process approved claims accurately and efficiently
  As an admin
  I need to generate payments for approved claims
  
Scenario: Generating payment for an approved claim
  Given I approve a claim after manual verification
  When I initiate the payment generation process
  Then the payment system should calculate the payment amount accurately based on the approved claim details, such as coverage, deductibles, and limits
  And the payment should be generated efficiently, including necessary approvals and financial processing

Feature: AI-Powered Chatbots Integration

In order to provide efficient support and reduce workload
As an admin
I need to integrate AI-powered chatbots

Scenario: Chatbot assisting with FAQs
  Given I am logged into the system as an admin
  And I have integrated an AI-powered chatbot into the website
  When a user interacts with the chatbot on the website's FAQ page
  Then the chatbot should analyze the user's query
  And it should provide accurate and helpful responses based on predefined FAQ knowledge base
  And if the chatbot cannot provide a satisfactory response, it should escalate the query to human support for further assistance

Scenario: Chatbot handling policy inquiries
  Given I am logged into the system as an admin
  And I have trained the AI chatbot with policy-related information and FAQs
  When a user inquires about policy details, coverage, or renewal options through the chatbot
  Then the chatbot should understand the user's intent and context
  And it should provide detailed information about policies, coverage options, renewal procedures, and premium payments
  And the chatbot should guide the user through the necessary steps for policy management, such as updating personal information or submitting claims

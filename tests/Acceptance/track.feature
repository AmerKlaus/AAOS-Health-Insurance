Feature: Track Claim Status

  In order to ensure timely resolution
  As an admin
  I need to track the real-time status of each claim

  Scenario: Tracking claim status
    Given I am logged into the system as an admin
    And I have navigated to the claim status tracking page
    When I view the page
    Then I should see a list of all claims
    And each claim should display its real-time status, such as "Pending," "In Progress," or "Resolved"
    And I should be able to filter and search for specific claims based on various criteria, such as claim ID or status
    And I should have the option to sort the claims based on different parameters, such as submission date or priority
    And I should be able to click on a claim to view detailed information, including claim details, interactions, and any assigned tasks or notes

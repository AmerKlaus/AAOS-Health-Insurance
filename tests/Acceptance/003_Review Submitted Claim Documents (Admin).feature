Feature: Review Claim Documents

  In order to ensure completeness and accuracy of claim documents
  As an admin
  I need to review submitted claim documents

  Scenario: Reviewing claim documents
    Given I am logged into the system as an admin
    When I navigate to the claims review section
    Then I should be able to view submitted claim documents
    And the documents should be presented in an organized manner, allowing for easy review and assessment

  Scenario: Providing feedback on claim documents
    Given I am reviewing claim documents
    When I identify missing or inaccurate information
    And request additional information from the customer
    Then the customer should be notified to provide the necessary documentation
    And the notification should include clear instructions on how to provide the requested information
    And the customer should have a convenient method to submit the requested documents, such as through an online portal or email attachment
    And upon receiving the requested documents, the claim review process should resume, with the updated information taken into consideration

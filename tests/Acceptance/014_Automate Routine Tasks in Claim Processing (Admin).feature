Feature: Automate Routine Tasks

In order to improve efficiency in claim processing
As an admin
I need to automate routine tasks such as data entry or document verification

Scenario: Automating data entry
  Given I am logged into the system as an admin
  And I am processing a claim
  When I encounter fields with standard data that can be automatically filled
  And the system recognizes these standard data fields
  Then the system should automatically populate these fields to reduce manual data entry

Scenario: Automating document verification
  Given I am logged into the system as an admin
  And I am verifying claim documents
  When I identify standard verification procedures for certain types of documents
  And the system has predefined criteria for document verification
  Then the system should automatically verify these documents based on the predefined criteria
